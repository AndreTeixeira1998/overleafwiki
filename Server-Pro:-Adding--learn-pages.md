If you want or need access to Overleaf documentation on your instance of Overleaf Server Pro, then set `--env SHARELATEX_PROXY_LEARN=true`. Documentation will be enabled at the `/learn` path.

This will proxy requests to the main [Overleaf documentation site](https://www.overleaf.com/learn), where it is always up to date. Note that this means your local server will perform external `GET` requests to `overleaf.com`.
