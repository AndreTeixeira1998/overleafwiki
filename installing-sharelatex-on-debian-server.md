Im almost there. :-)

I'm working on a debian server, which has only two ports open.
Apache is running on the one I would/could use. So that means as a proxy. I more or less think I know how to do this.

The problem however is redis. I'm unable to connect to redis on the 6379 port, as that one is not open.
How do I fix this one?

Regards,
