Overleaf has many dependencies.

You should install Overleaf with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and docker-compose, so they will be installed automatically.

Please follow the [Docker installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for your platform to install Docker and docker-compose, if they are not already installed.

You should have a recent, supported version of Docker, at least version 17.09.

If docker is installed correctly, you should be able to run these commands without error:
```
docker --version
docker-compose --version
docker ps
```

Once you have Docker and docker-composed installed, have a look at the [[Quick Start Guide]] to download the `docker-compose.yml` file for ShareLaTeX.
